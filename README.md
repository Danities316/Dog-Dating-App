# Dog-Dating-App
A Tinder kind of app but for dogs, wjere dogs owners can create account for their dogs and also allowed their dogs have sex with other dogs
social app for dog lovers who want to connect with other owners nearby that share a similar passion for canines.
It can also help owners socialise their pet and perhaps arrange dog-dates.

The users can create a profile for their pooch on the app and search to find new furry and human friends. 
They can chat, share photos and create events to connect with other dog lovers in their area. 

Based on Global Positioning System (GPS) location, the app will suggest nearby 
matches and - much like Tinder - allows users to swipe left (no) or right (has potential) through recommended profiles.
If both users swipe right, then it's a match and the new friends can chat to learn more or arrange a meet-up.
